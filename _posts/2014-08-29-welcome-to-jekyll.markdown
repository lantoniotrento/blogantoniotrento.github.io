You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve --watch`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].

{% highlight js %}

<footer class="site-footer">
 <a class="subscribe" href="{{ "/feed.xml" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"> <span class="tooltip"> <i class="fa fa-rss"></i> Subscribe!</span></a>

> This is Markdown Cheatsheet Demo for **Thinkspace**, this Jekyll theme. Please check the raw content of this file for the markdown usage.

## Typography Elements in One

Let's start with a informative paragraph. **This text is bolded.** But not this one! _How about italic text?_ Cool right? Ok, let's **_combine_** them together. Yeah, that's right! I have code to highlight, so `ThisIsMyCode()`. What a nice! Good people will hyperlink away, so [here we go](#) or [http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com).

<div class="divider"></div>

## Headings H1 to H6

# H1 Heading

## H2 Heading

### H3 Heading

#### H4 Heading

##### H5 Heading

###### H6 Heading

<div class="divider"></div>

## Footnote

Let's say you have text that you want to refer with a footnote, you can do that too! This is an example for the footnote number one [[^1]]. You can even add more footnotes, with link! [[^2]]

<div class="divider"></div>

## Blockquote

> Start by doing what's necessary; then do what's possible; and suddenly you are doing the impossible. --Francis of Assisi

**NOTE:** This theme does NOT support nested blockquotes.

<div class="divider"></div>

## List Items

1. First order list item
2. Second item

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

<div class="divider"></div>

## Code Blocks

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

<div class="divider"></div>

## Table

### Table 1: With Alignment

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

### Table 2: With Typography Elements

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

<div class="divider"></div>

## Horizontal Line

The HTML `<hr>` element is for creating a "thematic break" between paragraph-level elements. In markdown, you can create a `<hr>` with any of the following:

* `___`: three consecutive underscores
* `---`: three consecutive dashes
* `***`: three consecutive asterisks

renders to:

___
